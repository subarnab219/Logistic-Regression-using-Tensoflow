# Logistic-Regression-using-Tensoflow
Implementation of Logistic Regression (predict a image is of chair-recliner or not) using Tensorflow.


We are going to implement Logistic Regression using Tensorflow. We have scraped images of various products from a leading retail website. Images are arranged in a folder structure where the name of the folder designates what kind of product is the image. We are going to train a model in order to classify whether an image is of a 'chair-recliners' or not. For ease, we are going to train the model using only 'FURNITURE' data.
